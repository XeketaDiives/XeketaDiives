- 👋 I’m @XeketaDiives.Russian, no english laguaue. I'm a beginner and I don't know anything about encodings and programs. a person with the status of a debag of memory
- 👀 I’m interested in ... here I am.just to try the modes of the developer's tool to experiment with blender models. They have already been downloaded for such a project as the kk of the naestrof. blender,unity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...blender, unity for your own purposes. I am looking for avatars that are interesting to me and, if possible, insert them either game. or play them in the viar chat... on a laptop. I'm a beggar for viar headsets)
- 💞️ I’m I'm not looking for cooperation. 1) As described above, I am new to programs. 2) All my experiments concern only one project. and they will be private only to me... 3) except if I manage to insert blender.vrm.obj models, etc. into the project. 4)In addition, if the projects I am interested in provide open source code, I will also take care of them. I don't promise that I will be online.
- 📫 How to reach me ...telegram, discord...I don't answer the phone. and also by SMS in English.
- 😄 Pronouns: ...I'm giving you permission.call me by any name. if you honor adaptive high culture.(no, it's not about music.paintings)You know what it's about...Also if you're a comfort preacher
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...there is a Russian language and a git command line on github. It's a pity, of course, that everything else in English is technical. I have memory problems. Therefore, I cannot afford to use the help of professional programmers. I can offer ideas, but I will be a pirate even if I send links from the original. For example, add functions to the KK. from the game aliens vs predator. We play as 9 aliens, a 1-person view from the mouth. climbing on surfaces and hitting the tail. or add heketa diives' multifunctional beast, darling...You know who I'm talking about
